Practical Methodology: 

1. content discovery: only way to discover api content is really by fuzzing. 
  	use ffuf (or maybe checkout feroxbuster if feeling roudy) 	to perform a recursive fuzz on the api. 
	
	***** use the seclist/webcontent/api/ wordlists for this.  	
	ffuf is also capable of issuing post requests! Well want 	to test what methods the API accepts prior to fuzzing
