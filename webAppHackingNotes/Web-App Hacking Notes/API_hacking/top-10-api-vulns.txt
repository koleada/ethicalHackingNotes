10 API vulnerabilities
The OWASP Foundation periodically publishes a list of critical API-specific security risks. Although some of these risks have a different name in the context of APIs, many of them align with our existing Web Security Academy topics.

Essentially APIs can lead to many of the vulnerabilities we already know about. 

The table below specifies which Web Security Academy topics are relevant to the OWASP Top 10 API vulnerabilities:


-Broken object-level authorization

	Access control vulnerabilities and privilege escalation

-Broken authentication

	Authentication vulnerabilities

	OAuth 2.0 authentication vulnerabilities

	JWT attacks

-Broken object property level authorization

	Mass assignment vulnerabilities

-Unrestricted resource consumption

	Race conditions

	File upload vulnerabilities

-Broken function level authorization

	Access control vulnerabilities and privilege escalation

-Unrestricted access to sensitive business flows

	Business logic vulnerabilities

-Server side request forgery


-Security misconfiguration:

	Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)

	Information disclosure vulnerabilities

	HTTP Host header attacks

	HTTP request smuggling

-Improper inventory management


-Unsafe consumption of APIs
