# ethicalHackingNotes
A repo for all of the notes I take regarding ethical hacking and cyber security! 

When I first started learning about secuirty I was taking notes on my Ipad which are very difficult to export and backup (if you dont want to pay for icloud). Needless to say Ive learned my lesson, hence why I created this repo :)
